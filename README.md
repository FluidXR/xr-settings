# XR Settings
Every XR app seems to have the same onboarding process of setting up your preferred accessibility and locomotion settings. Wouldn't it be easy if any game could just check your global settings and use that as the default? 

This is the problem that GUS (Global User Settings) solves. Developers can include GUS in their Unity/Unreal/Native projects and retrieve your settings that you have already set in other apps.
